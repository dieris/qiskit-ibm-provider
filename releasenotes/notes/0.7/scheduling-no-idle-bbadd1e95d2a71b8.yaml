features:
  - |
    Added a new flag, ``schedule_idle_qubits`` to the constructor for the
    :class:`.PadDelay` and :class:`.PadDynamicalDecoupling` passes. This
    flag when set to ``True`` will have the scheduling passes insert a full
    circuit duration delay on any idle qubits in the circuit.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default behavior of the :class:`.PadDelay` and
    :class:`.PadDynamicalDecoupling` passes for idle qubits in the circuit
    have changed. Previously, by default the passes would schedule any idle
    qubits in the circuit by inserting a delay equal to the full circuit
    duration. This has been changed so by default only active qubits are
    scheduled. This change was made because the extra delays were additional
    overhead in the job payload that were effectively a no-op so they added
    extra overhead to job submission for no gain. If you need to restore
    the previous behavior you can instantiate :class:`.PadDelay` or
    :class:`.PadDynamicalDecoupling` with the keyword argument
    ``schedule_idle_qubits=True`` which will restore the previous behavior.
