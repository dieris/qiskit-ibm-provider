    Added support for using session. The syntax here is slightly different than that
    in ``qiskit-ibm-runtime``, but the functionality is similar.
    Here is an example using session as a context manager:
    
    .. code-block::
    
      with backend.open_session() as session:
        job = backend.run(ReferenceCircuits.bell())
    
    And here is an example of session not as a context manager:
    
    .. code-block::
    
      backend = IBMProvider().get_backend("ibmq_qasm_simulator")
      backend.open_session()
      job = backend.run(circ)
      backend.cancel_session()
